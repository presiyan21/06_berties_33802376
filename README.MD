# Bertie’s Books

A simple Node.js web application for managing a bookshop’s inventory. This project demonstrates how to build a dynamic web app using **Express**, **EJS**, and **MySQL**.  
Users can view all books, search for titles, add new books, and see bargain books priced under £20.  

---

## Technologies Used

- **HTML / EJS** – for structuring and templating web pages (`.ejs` files in the `views` folder)  
- **CSS** – for styling the pages (`main.css` in the `public` folder)  
- **Node.js** – runtime environment for the application (`index.js`)  
- **Express** – web framework used to handle routes and serve pages  
- **MySQL** – relational database for storing books and user data  
- **mysql2** – Node.js library used to connect Express with MySQL  
- **path** – built-in Node module to handle file paths
- **bcrypt** – used for hashing user passwords securely.
- **dotenv** – used to secure database credentials outside of source code.

## Main Features

- View all books in a clean, formatted list  
- Add new books to the database through a form  
- Search for books (exact or partial match)  
- Display bargain books priced below £20  
- Register new users (with hashed passwords)
- Secure User Login** and Audit Logging
- Dynamic templates rendered with EJS

### Dotenv 
To keep sensitive database settings out of the source code, the app now uses the **dotenv** module.  
It’s loaded at the top of `index.js`, and all connection details were moved into a `.env` file.  
The app now reads these values using `process.env` instead of hardcoded credentials.

---

### Audit Logging 
A login audit system was added to record both successful and failed login attempts.  
A new `audit_log` table stores each attempt with the username, result, and timestamp.  
A helper function in `routes/users.js` writes entries to the table, and the login route logs an attempt after every authentication check.  
A new `/users/audit` route was added to display the full login history, with the most recent entries first.


## How to Install and Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/presiyan21/06_berties_33802376
## Installation and Setup

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up Database and Test Data

Open your MySQL client and create the database, including the user and book data, and the final marking user:

```sql
SOURCE create_db.sql;
SOURCE insert_test_data.sql;
```
### 4. Configure database connection

Create a file named .env and add the following content:

```js
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=berties_books_app
DB_PASSWORD=qwertyuiop
DB_DATABASE=berties_books
PORT=8000
});
```

### 5. Run the server
